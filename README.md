# interviewChallenger-1

Here in this repository I am solving a challenge from an interview I saw.

With the following instructions:
  - The user can click anywhere on the page;
  - When clicked a small circle should be rendered where it was clicked.
  - Each click maintains the circles already made and creates new ones;
  - And I have two features:
    - undo and redo
